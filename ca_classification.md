In my [last post](/blog/turing-basins){:target=”blank”}, I shared my journey through understanding the link between entropy, thermodynamics, evolution, computation, and mathematics. At the end, I shared some preliminary research on using entropy/complexity to classify Cellular Automata objectively. At that time, I only had a handful of samples which, albeit showing promise, fell short of demonstrating concrete results.

I am incredibly excited to share that I have now run my simulations on _every single possible_ Life-Like Cellular Automaton rule (a total of 262,144 rules), and it shows some amazing promise in classifying every single rule based on its emergent behavior. Not only that, but this method establishes what appears to be a strong metric for finding "islands" of rules that have similar behavior.
